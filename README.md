NiceGUI Chat Application
Overview
This project is a simple chat application built using the NiceGUI framework. It allows users to send and receive messages in a chatroom-style interface. Each user is assigned a unique avatar generated by RoboHash, ensuring that all users have a distinct visual identity.

Features
Unique User Identification: Each user is automatically assigned a unique ID and avatar when they join the chat.
Real-Time Chat: Messages are displayed in real-time, with users able to see their own messages and those sent by others.
Intuitive Interface: The chat application features an easy-to-use interface, with a message input field and automatic display of chat messages.


Run the Application:
Execute the Python script to start the chat server:

bash
Copy code
python chat_app.py
This will start the NiceGUI server, and the application will be accessible via http://localhost:8080 by default.

Use the Chat Application:

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080.
Enter a message in the input field and press Enter to send it.
Your message, along with your unique avatar, will be displayed in the chat area.

File Structure
chat_app.py: The main Python file containing the code for the NiceGUI chat application.
README.md: This file provides an overview of the application and instructions on how to run it.
Customization
Avatar Source: The avatars are generated using the RoboHash service. You can change the avatar source or customize the avatars by modifying the avatar variable in the index function.
User Identification: Users are identified by a unique UUID generated at runtime. If you want to implement user authentication or persistent identities, you'll need to modify the user assignment logic.
Styling: The application's appearance can be customized by modifying the classes used in the ui components.
